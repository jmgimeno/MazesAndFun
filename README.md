Mazes & Fun
===========

Translation to Haskell of (some) algorithms for maze generation from the book "Mazes for Programmers" by Jamis Buck.

Developed with 'Haskell for Mac' but buildable with:

    $ stack build

and executable with

    $ stack exec MazesAndFun

The generated maze is in file "maze.svg"
