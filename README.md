Mazes & Fun
===========

Translation to Haskell of (some) algorithms for maze generation from the book "Mazes for Programmers" by Jamis Buck.

Developed with 'Haskell for Mac' but buildable with:

    $ stack build

and executable with

    $ stack exec MazesAndFun maze.svg 600 50

The [generated maze] (https://github.com/jmgimeno/MazesAndFun/blob/master/maze.svg) is in file "maze.svg", its image size is 600 by 600 and it has 50 rows and columns.
